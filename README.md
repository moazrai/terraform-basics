## Automate Terraform with GitHub Actions

Automating Terraform with CI/CD to enforce configuration best practices, promote collaboration and automate the Terraform workflow.

Note: In the production environment, add "Require status checks to pass before merging" as a Branch Protection rule. This adds a layer of protection, ensuring that this workflow successfully completes before changes are merged into main.
